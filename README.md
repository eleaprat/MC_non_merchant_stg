# MC_non_merchant_stg
You can find here the code for the article ["Virtual Linking Bids for Market Clearing with Non-Merchant Storage"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14787). It runs with Julia v1.11.4 and the packages JuMP v1.11.4 (optimization), HiGHS v1.15.0 (solver), CSV v0.10.15 and DataFrames v1.7.0.

## Run the different market clearings
The notebook **main_notebook.ipynb** should be run to compare the different market clearings. The data can be updated in the notebook and through the files **data_gen.csv** and **data_load.csv**.

## Examples from the paper
The csv files for the examples of the paper are available in the corresponding folders.
